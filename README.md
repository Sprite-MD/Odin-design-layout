Practicing using HTML and CSS to build a website layout according to https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page.

The box model  
Used flexbox to design responsive layouts   
Utilized nested divs and CSS to create containers that help structure a coherent design  

Going forward:
